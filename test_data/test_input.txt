A case of a patient with type 1 neurofibromatosis associated with popliteal and coronary artery aneurysms is described in which cross-sectional imaging provided diagnostic information. The aim of this study was to compare the exercise intensity and competition load during Time Trial (TT), Flat (FL), Medium Mountain (MM) and High Mountain (HM) stages based heart rate (HR) and session rating of perceived exertion (RPE).METHODS: We monitored both HR and RPE of 12 professional cyclists during two consecutive 21-day cycling races in order to analyze the exercise intensity and competition load (TRIMPHR and TRIMPRPE). RESULTS:The highest (P<0.05) mean HR was found in TT (169±2 bpm) versus those observed in FL (135±1 bpm), MM (139±3 bpm), HM (143±1 bpm)

The association of body mass index (BMI) with blood pressure may be stronger in Asian than non-Asian populations, however, longitudinal studies with direct comparisons between ethnicities are lacking. We compared the relationship of BMI with incident hypertension over approximately 9.5 years of follow-up in young (24-39 years) and middle-aged (45-64 years) Chinese Asians (n=5354), American Blacks (n=6076) and American Whites (n=13451). We estimated risk differences using logistic regression models and calculated adjusted incidences and incidence differences. To facilitate comparisons across ethnicities, standardized estimates were calculated using mean covariate values for age, sex, smoking, education and field center, and included the quadratic terms for BMI and age. Weighted least-squares regression models with were constructed to summarize ethnic-specific incidence differences across BMI. Wald statistics and p-values were calculated based on chi-square distributions. The association of BMI with the incidence difference for hypertension was steeper in Chinese (p<0.05) than in American populations during young and middle-adulthood. For example, at a BMI of 25 vs 21 kg/m2 the adjusted incidence differences per 1000 persons (95% CI) in young adults with a BMI of 25 vs those with a BMI of 21 was 83 (36- 130) for Chinese, 50 (26-74) for Blacks and 30 (12-48) for Whites
